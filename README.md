## Project Spec

## Abstract 

Garden Grow was designed with garden lover's in mind! Whether you're an experienced or novice gardener, there's always more to learn. It can be hard to keep track of seasonal planting dates, water quantity, and sun. Not sure where to start? Enter your zipcode on the home page and grab your hardiness zone within the United States, along with planting details for a variety of veggies. Users with profiles can also save different veggies to their gardens. 

Garden Grow was built in 10 days by 3 back-end engineers and 4 front-end engineers for the Capstone Project at Turing School of Software and Design. 

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate knowledge you’ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented               architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
- Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## WinsAndChallenges

Team Planning & Work Processes - 
- Wins- Spent almost a full week planning with front and back-end together in order to determine the data that would be coming in.
- Built github project board that the entire team utilized for the extent of the project. 
- Had daily standups with front and back-end to go over progress/blockers, check in with everyone.
- Had weekly retros with the entire team to go over how the week went and what everyone would like to see more/less of for the coming week.

Stretch Goals
- Successfully implemented GraphGl and ApolloClient 
- Successfully implemented CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Successfully implemented full coverage Cypress testing with GraphGL

Git Workflow

CI & Deployment
- CI Deployment was really helpful implementing and agile workflow were group members were working async.
- CI also presented challenges when Cypress tests were working on local machines but wouldn't pass in CI.
- Successfully deployed through Vercel for the front end and Heroku for back-end.

Testing
- Successfully implemented 80-90% test coverage for all components.

Future features would include a calendar with all of the user's planting and harvesting dates for each month as well as watering reminders every week.
